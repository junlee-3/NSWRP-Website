            <h1>About NSWRP</h1>
            <p>We started NSWRP, cause American servers I owned wasn't going anywhere, I saw that there were not much Australian servers based, 
                me and Alex changed an American server that we owned and change the names, and kicked all the members and decided to re-start and 
                try working our way up and eventually we actually hit our main goal which was 500 members, we then proceeded gaining more members and staff members and a month later, 
                we hit our dream goal of 1,000 members.

            <h1>Why are we based in NSW?</h1>
            <p>NSWRP is based on NSW due to me living in New South Wales, I thought that everyone would enjoy an Australian Roleplay Server,
                 me and Alex both lived in New South Wales and we came to an agreement of creating a NSW Australian based server. 
                 We also liked the liveries we had in New South Wales and seemed people would enjoy them if we were to create them, we didn't know we were going to become big,
                but it took us weeks and weeks and we eventually hit 1,000 members.
